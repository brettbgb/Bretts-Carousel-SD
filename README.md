Brett Bisyak Carousel

NOTE: formatting appears odd for some of my files in Git hub file view: view files in another editor such as sublime text.

This is a Backbone carousel created from scratch by Brett Bisyak on August 6 2016.
It loads backbone, jquery and underscore from cdn so you will need an internet connection.
Also the images are loaded from itunes via "http://itunes.apple.com/search?term=classic+rock&limit=20".


1. to run view the Carousel.html file in the top level folder.
2. there are 3 sub folders ( collections, models and views ) that should come out of the repository.
3. keeping it simple for now, just the carousel and tooltip on each image for song name.
4. would use require modules ideally.
